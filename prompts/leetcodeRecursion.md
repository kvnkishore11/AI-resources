Prompt:
I have the following problem: [insert problem description here].

Can you provide a detailed explanation of how to arrive at the solution by yourself? I’d like you to include:
	1.	Problem Breakdown: Explain what the problem is asking in your own words.
	2.	Key Insights: Describe the core observations or insights that help simplify the problem (for example, the recognition of a recursive structure or combinatorial nature).
	3.	Step-by-Step Process: Outline your thought process using a clear backtracking template, covering:
	•	Base Condition: When and why the recursion should terminate.
	•	Hypothesis: How to choose/define the decision at each step.
	•	Induction: How the recursive (or iterative) call builds up the answer.
	•	Return/Backtracking: How you undo a decision to try alternative solutions.
	4.	Sample Code: Provide a complete example (in Python) implementing this approach.
	5.	General Tips: Explain how this method can be applied to similar problems.

I want the answer to detail how I could naturally arrive at the solution by myself—breaking the problem down into smaller sub-problems, setting up the recursive case, and then combining the results. Please follow your usual clear, step-by-step reasoning and use the common backtracking structure.
