Prompt:
I have a problem on [Platform] and I’d like to approach it with a template-driven mindset that improves my chances of success. The problem is: [insert full problem description here].

Could you provide a comprehensive explanation of the thought process behind solving this problem, including:
	1.	Problem Breakdown:
	•	Restate the problem in your own words.
	•	Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints.
	2.	Key Insights & Observations:
	•	Identify important insights or edge cases.
	•	Describe any common patterns (e.g., two-pointers, sliding window, recursion/backtracking, dynamic programming, greedy) that might apply.
	3.	Step-by-Step Approach:
	•	Provide a detailed walkthrough of how to derive the solution.
	•	Use a template that highlights the following:
a. Base Condition: Explain when or why the recursive or iterative process should terminate.
b. Hypothesis: Describe how to decide on candidate moves/choices or state transitions.
c. Induction: Detail how to build the solution from smaller sub-problems (recursive call or iterative update).
d. Return/Backtracking: Explain how to assemble or backtrack the solution.
	4.	Black Box Template:
	•	Please include a general “black box” solution template applicable to many problems. This should be a step-by-step pseudocode or explanation that I can plug into problems with minimal adjustments.
	5.	Boilerplate Code:
	•	Provide boilerplate (scaffold) code (preferably in Python) that implements the template.
	•	The code should cover typical input processing, structure (like a class or function definition), and a framework for either recursion/backtracking or an iterative approach.
	6.	Complexity Analysis:
	•	Briefly explain the time and space complexity of the approach.
	7.	General Tips:
	•	Share some insights on how this method can be adapted to other problems.

I want the answer to present a step-by-step, template-driven approach that I can use to tackle problems more systematically.
