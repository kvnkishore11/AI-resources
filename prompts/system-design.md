# Comprehensive System Design Interview Training Prompt

## Context and Goal
I am preparing for system design interviews at FAANG-level companies. I'm currently an absolute beginner in system design and want to reach an expert level. I need a comprehensive training program that includes practical exercises, case studies, theoretical concepts, and ethical considerations.

## Training Structure Request
Please create a structured, progressive training program that will take me from a complete beginner to an expert in system design interviews. The program should:

1. Start with fundamental concepts assuming no prior knowledge of system design
2. Gradually increase in complexity to cover advanced topics required for FAANG interviews
3. Include a mix of learning approaches:
   - Theoretical concepts and principles
   - Practical exercises with step-by-step guidance
   - Real-world case studies of existing systems
   - Ethical considerations in system design
4. Provide hands-on practice opportunities with detailed feedback
5. Include common interview questions and strategies for answering them effectively

## Specific Areas to Cover

### Fundamentals (Beginner Level)
- Basic system design principles and terminology
- Client-server architecture
- Network protocols (HTTP, TCP/IP, etc.)
- APIs and their design
- Database basics (SQL vs NoSQL, ACID properties)
- Caching fundamentals
- Basic scalability concepts

### Intermediate Topics
- Load balancing strategies
- Database sharding and partitioning
- Replication strategies
- Consistency models (strong, eventual, etc.)
- Microservices architecture
- Message queues and event-driven architecture
- Content delivery networks (CDNs)
- Rate limiting and throttling

### Advanced Topics (Expert Level)
- Distributed systems design patterns
- Consensus algorithms (Paxos, Raft)
- Consistent hashing
- CAP theorem and its implications
- System resilience and fault tolerance
- Data processing systems (batch, stream)
- Global-scale system considerations
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security considerations at scale

### Practical Case Studies
- Design a URL shortener
- Design a social media feed
- Design a distributed file storage system
- Design a video streaming service
- Design an e-commerce platform
- Design a ride-sharing application
- Design a messaging system
- Design a recommendation system

### Ethical Considerations
- Privacy by design principles
- Data minimization strategies
- Ethical implications of recommendation systems
- Accessibility considerations
- Environmental impact of system design choices
- Bias in algorithms and data
- Security and protection of user data

## Learning Format
For each topic and case study, please provide:
1. Clear explanations of concepts with real-world examples
2. Visual diagrams where appropriate
3. Step-by-step approach to solving design problems
4. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
5. Trade-offs to consider and how to discuss them in interviews
6. Follow-up questions interviewers might ask

## Interview Preparation
- Framework for approaching any system design question
- Time management during interviews
- How to clarify requirements effectively
- Techniques for communicating design decisions
- How to handle feedback and iterate on designs
- Strategies for showcasing technical depth and breadth

## Progress Tracking
- Provide milestones to track progress from beginner to expert
- Include self-assessment questions for each topic
- Suggest ways to validate understanding before moving to more advanced topics

Please act as my personal system design interview coach, providing detailed guidance, constructive feedback, and challenging me with increasingly complex scenarios as I progress through the training program.
