Prompt:
I have the following problem: [insert full problem description here].

Could you explain how to approach this problem from scratch? I’d like a detailed explanation that shows my thought process, including:
	1.	Problem Breakdown:
	•	Restate the problem in your own words.
	•	Identify the input, desired output, and any constraints.
	2.	Key Insights & Observations:
	•	Point out any important observations or edge cases.
	•	Describe common patterns (e.g., sliding window, two-pointer, dynamic programming, greedy, recursion/backtracking, etc.) that might apply.
	3.	Approach Discussion:
	•	Outline multiple solution strategies where applicable (brute-force, optimized, etc.).
	•	Explain the pros and cons of each approach.
	4.	Algorithm Design & Step-by-Step Explanation:
	•	For your chosen approach, provide a step-by-step breakdown of how you would develop a solution.
	•	Include the base condition/hypothesis/inductive step if it involves recursion/backtracking, or explain your iterative strategy, state transitions, and how you ensure correctness otherwise.
	5.	Pseudo-code or Sample Code:
	•	Provide a complete implementation (preferably in Python) that reflects the approach.
	6.	Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
	•	Explain the complexity of your solution and how you derived it.
	7.	General Tips:
	•	Offer insights into how this approach can be adapted to similar problems.

I want a comprehensive answer that mirrors the thinking process I should follow to develop a solution on my own.
