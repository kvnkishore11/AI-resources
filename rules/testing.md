# Test-Driven Development Process Guideline

When developing a new feature or making changes to existing code, adhere to the following process to ensure robust, high-quality implementations:

## 1. Write Comprehensive Unit Test Cases First

- Before implementing any feature or functionality, create unit test cases that cover all expected behaviors, edge cases, and potential failure scenarios.
- Test cases should validate the correctness of the feature, including:
  - Normal case scenarios (expected inputs and outputs)
  - Edge cases (boundary conditions, extreme values)
  - Error cases (invalid inputs, failure modes)
- Use a testing framework appropriate for the programming language (e.g., JUnit for Java, pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript).
- Ensure test cases are clear, maintainable, and well-documented, with descriptive names that reflect the functionality being tested.

## 2. Implement the Feature

- Only after writing and verifying the unit test cases, proceed to develop the feature or code changes.
- Write clean, modular, and maintainable code that adheres to the project's coding standards and best practices.
- Ensure the implementation satisfies all test cases, with tests passing successfully before considering the feature complete.

## 3. Achieve at Least 90% Code Coverage

- Use a code coverage tool (e.g., JaCoCo for Java, coverage.py for Python, Istanbul for JavaScript) to measure the coverage of your unit tests.
- Ensure that at least 90% of the code (lines, branches, and functions) is covered by the unit tests.
- Address any uncovered code by writing additional test cases or refactoring the implementation to eliminate untested paths, while avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- Exclude non-functional code (e.g., comments, configurations) from coverage calculations, but strive for comprehensive testing of all logic.

## 4. Validate and Refactor

- Run all unit tests after implementation to confirm the feature works as expected and meets the 90% coverage requirement.
- Refactor the code if necessary to improve readability, performance, or maintainability, ensuring that all tests continue to pass.
- Update test cases if refactoring introduces new behaviors or changes existing ones.

## 5. Automate Testing

- Integrate unit tests into the project's continuous integration (CI) pipeline to ensure tests are run automatically on every code change.
- Review test results and coverage reports in the CI pipeline to catch issues early.

---

By following this test-driven development approach, you ensure that every feature is thoroughly tested, reliable, and maintainable, with a minimum of 90% code coverage to guarantee high code quality.
